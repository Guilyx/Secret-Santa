# Secret Santa Generator

## Setup

To setup the project on your local machine:

1. Click on `Fork`.
2. Go to your fork and `clone` the project to your local machine.
3. `git clone https://github.com/Guilyx/secret-santa.git`

## Run

To run the project for your personal use, write a shell script in the scripts/ folder as followed :

```
python3 main.py mail=sender-email@example.com pw=sender-password<< EOF
4 # number of participants
John # names of the participants (more or less than 4 inputs not supported yet)
Doe
Foo
Bar
email1@example.com
email2@example.com
email3@example.com
email4@example.com
EOF
```

Launch the shell script from the project's root :

```sh scripts/scriptname.sh```

Another way to do it is to use the command line interface by simply running :

```python3 main.py mail=sender-email@example.com pw=sender-password```

Then let the interface guide you. ( It's still more conveniant with the first option. ) Feel free to contribute by starting a GUI, the idea is in the books but time lacks.
